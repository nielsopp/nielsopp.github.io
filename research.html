<h1>Current Role</h1>

<center>
<div>
At Accelerate Diagnostics, my team and I try to provide physicians with the right information to select antimicrobial therapy for septic patients. We develop automated diagnostic systems that expose bacteria contained in blood samples to various antimicrobials and take a series of images over a time frame of a few hours. Based on these images, we aim to quantify how susceptible the bacteria in a given sample will be long-term to treatment with the same antimicrobials. In making that prediction, we employ computer vision techniques to quantify the behavior of bacterial cells visible in the images and train machine learning-based models to identify the minimum concentration of each antimicrobial to which the bacteria will be susceptible. Along the way we develop numerous diagnostic metrics and tools that allow us to make sense of the data and give directions for improvements to the physical boundary conditions both inside and outside of our instruments.<br />

<h2>Non-parametric Bayesian inference</h2>
Measurement data always consist of a finite set of numbers. Quantities 
in nature, however, are often continuously distributed and thus possess 
infinitely many degrees of freedom. To infer such continuous quantities 
from finite observations, we have to make use of prior information to 
regularize the solution. The description of the prior statistics often 
contains unknown parameters itself, leading to a hierarchical 
description of the available information.<br>
I have developed algorithms for the reconstruction of continuous 
quantities under the assumption of Gaussian or log-normal statistics 
without precise knowledge of the prior. One of my algorithms even 
overcomes the presence of unknown outliers in a data set.<br>
The image shows the reconstruction of a power spectrum, describing the 
prior statistics of a log-normal field, making use of a spectral 
smoothness prior.<br>

<h2>Interstellar magnetic fields</h2>
Magnetic fields in the Galactic interstellar medium show structure over a
 large range of scales, from coherent fields on the scale of the whole 
Milky Way down to (almost) the smallest scales we can resolve in 
observations. These magnetic fields are generally believed to be caused 
by a dynamo mechanism that converts the kinetic energy of turbulent gas 
motion into magnetic energy, aided by the rotation of the Galactic disk.
 The details, however, are somewhat unclear and observational 
constraints are sparse.<br>
I make use of measurements of radiation that has been influenced by 
interstellar magnetic fields, i.e., synchrotron and thermal dust 
emission, as well as Faraday rotation measurements, to try to constrain 
the properties of interstellar magnetic fields. I am especially 
interested in the statistical properties of the small-scale magnetic 
features, which may help us shed light on the underlying dynamo 
mechanism. One aspect I've worked on is magnetic helicity, that is, the 
twistiness of the magnetic field lines.<br>
The image shows a rough sketch of the &#945;-&#937;-dynamo, a mechanism that can (maybe) explain why the Milky Way is magnetic.<br>

<h2>CMB foregrounds</h2>
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation stems from a time 400000
 years after the Big Bang and has traveled to us (almost) undisturbed 
since then. As such, it holds information on the physical processes 
taking place when the Universe was very young. However, in large parts 
of the sky this radiation is swamped by radiation due to other effects, 
happening much closer to home. These are the Galactic foregrounds, 
synchrotron radiation, emission from dust grains, emission from 
scattered particles, etc. We need to separate these processes from the 
CMB to make use of the former for cosmology and from each other to make 
use of them to further our understanding of the Galactic interstellar 
medium. The main lever for disentangling the various foreground 
components is their different frequency dependence. I am working on an 
approach that additionally makes use of their correlations, both between
 components and between different locations.<br>
The image is a visualization of the measurements taken by the Planck 
satellite. These have been decomposed into the various physical 
processes, which are shown in different colors.<br>

<h2>Faraday rotation</h2>
When linearly polarized radiation propagates through a magnetized 
Plasma, its polarization plane is rotated. This effect, known as Faraday
 rotation, is sensitive to one of the three components of the magnetic 
field and thus can be used to study magnetic fields in diffuse plasmas. 
However, it is also notoriously difficult to measure reliably.<br>
In our studies, my colleagues and I have assembled the largest catalog 
of measurements of this effect to date, based on observations of 
extragalactic sources. The rotation that is recorded in the catalog for 
these sources is due to magnetic fields within the Milky Way, magnetic 
fields outside of the Milky Way, and faulty measurements. We were able 
to separate the Milky Way's contribution from the extragalactic 
contributions in the presence of faulty data by developing a dedicated 
Bayesian statistical analysis algorithm for this problem. Now we are in 
the process of developing and exploring statistical models to make sense
 of the, much smaller, extragalactic contributions. We hope to soon be 
able to constrain magnetic fields on much larger, cosmological, 
length-scales.<br>
The image shows our estimate of the amount of Faraday rotation due the 
the Milky Way's magnetic field as a function of position in the sky.<br>

<h2>21cm intensity mapping</h2>
When an electron residing in the ground state of a hydrogen atom 
undergoes a spin flip, it emits a photon of wavelength 21cm. Since there
 are a lot of hydrogen atoms in the Universe, there are also a lot of 
these photons and we can detect this radiation even if it comes from far
 away. Since the wavelength of the photons undergoes a redshift as the 
Universe expands, we can find these photons even at longer wavelengths 
and by measuring their wavelength immediately know how far they have 
traveled. Mapping out the intensity of this type of radiation as a 
function of distance and position on the sky, will lead to a map of the 
large-scale distribution of neutral hydrogen in the Universe, and thus 
of matter in general, the statistics of which will yield important 
constraints on cosmological parameters.<br>
This radiation, however, is swamped by radiation coming from within the 
Milky Way, just like the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is, only more
 so. However, just like in the case of the CMB, these foregrounds are 
not only something we need to get rid of, but also something that can 
teach us about our own galaxy. Since the observations need to take place
 in the radio regime, the main foreground is synchrotron radiation, 
which, via its polarization and the Faraday rotation that it undergoes, 
holds the key for understanding many aspects of the magnetic fields that
 surround us.<br>
I am involved in two projects that aim to map out the cosmological 21cm 
radiation. There, I am taking part in developing a pipeline that turns 
data into maps, in interpreting the cosmological information, in 
developing new tools for making maps of the foregrounds, and in 
interpreting those.<br>

<h2>Statistics of Fast Radio Bursts</h2>
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have been discovered only recently. Their name 
is fairly descriptive; they are fast (lasting only for about a 
millisecond), they appear at radio wavelengths, and they seem to happen 
in bursts (although that has only been established for one of them and 
only long after they were named). Another, perhaps the most interesting,
 aspect is that their radiation is highly dispersed, i.e., longer 
wavelengths arrive much later than shorter wavelengths. This can be 
explained by a large amount of ionized material between us and the 
sources, which led many people to believe that these sources are likely 
at cosmological distances.<br>
At present, only about 20 of such events have been observed. 
Nevertheless, there have been many claims regarding their distribution 
in space, time, and frequency. Many of these claims can be traced back 
to implicit assumptions that may or may not be justified. My colleagues 
at CITA and I have chimed in with some rigorously derived statistical 
statements.<br>
The image shows the posterior distribution for the expected event rate around 1.4 GHz and the slope of the flux distribution.<br>
