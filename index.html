<h1>Welcome</h1>
I am the Head of Data Science at <a href="http://www.axdx.com/">Accelerate Diagnostics</a>. My team and I develop algorithms to predict and quantify the susceptibility of bacterial samples to antimicrobials, using images from the automated Accelerate Pheno <sup>&#174;</sup> system containing a specialized, robotic, in-focus microscope, as well as the Accelerate Wave&#8482; system, which is under development and uses in-line holographic imaging.<br />

Before joining the fight against drug-resistant bacteria, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/">Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics</a>.
 There, my research focused on statistical questions related to data analysis 
and data interpretation. A specialty of mine are Bayesian algorithms aimed at  
extracting all available information from observations without 
introducing spurious signals. Astrophysical areas that I am interested 
in are cosmology, radio astronomy, and magnetic fields in diffuse media 
both inside and outside the Milky Way. I have contributed to the <a href="http://chime.phas.ubc.ca/">Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment</a>, the <a href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck">Planck Surveyor Mission</a>, the <a href="https://gmims.ok.ubc.ca/">Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey</a>, and was an associated member of the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/">Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics</a>.<br>
I invite you to take a look around this website and get in touch if you find something that interests you.<br>
